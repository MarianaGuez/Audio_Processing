  "You're Not You When You're Angry: Robust Emotion Features Emerge by Recognizing Speakers" is a paper by the authors: Zakaria Aldeneh, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, and
Emily Mower Provost, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. It explores through different experiments how embedding used for recognizing people's identities changes with emotional content.

This is a very interesting paper for exploring the field of emotion recognition. In this repository, I recreate one of their experiments to show the intuition behind the results.
