Thus, in the first iterations parsimony is promoted by GA mechanisms, i.e., replacing by crossover a high percentage of particles at the beginning. Subsequently, optimization with PSO becomes more relevant for the improvement of model accuracy. This differs from other hybrid methods in which the crossover is applied between the best individual position of each particle or other approaches in which the worst particles are also replaced by new particles, but at extreme positions.\n"
